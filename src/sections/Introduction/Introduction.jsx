        <strong>Hello!</strong>&nbsp;
        I'm MÃ­la, and I'm a software developer :)
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        I enjoy working with backend technologies and server administration.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        For the past 6+ years, my primary focus has been on <strong className="text-lime-700">Node.js</strong>. It's been my go-to language for both my career and also my personal projects.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        Lately, I've been also diving into <strong className="text-sky-500">Go</strong> as an elegant and efficient approach to create high-performance, cross-platform applications and scripts for both GUI and the command line.
      </p>
      <p className="mt-4">
        I'm a long-time Linux user, and daily drive <strong className="text-green-700">openSUSE Tumbleweed</strong>. I also boot into Arch Linux every now and then for learning purposes, but I don't use Arch btw. ;)
